I am a professor of materials science at the Institute for Condensed Matter Chemistry of Bordeaux (ICMCB, CNRS) and Bordeaux INP in France, which I joined in 2001. Since September 2025, I have been based in Singapore as an **Adjunct Senior Researcher at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, within CINTRA, working on AI-guided design of advanced materials. Since 2020, I have also held an **Honor Chair Professorship** at National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan).

My work focuses on **alloy design**, **high-entropy alloys (HEAs)**, and **artificial intelligence for materials science**. I combine physical metallurgy and computational thermodynamics with data-driven approaches to understand and design metallic materials for energy and sustainability.

## Research Focus

My work combines **alloy design**, **high-entropy and complex concentrated alloys (HEAs/CCAs)**, and **artificial intelligence for materials science**, with a strong emphasis on hybrid **physics–AI models**.

More specifically, I am interested in:
- **Designing and optimising HEAs and related alloys** for structural and functional applications,  
- **Using thermodynamic and mechanistic modelling** to rationalise phase stability and microstructure–property relationships,  
- **Developing machine learning and AI workflows**, from feature engineering and predictive models to active learning and closed-loop design, to accelerate materials discovery.

A central theme of my recent work is the development, analysis and application of **hybrid physics–AI models** for materials design and understanding, with three main directions:

1. **Physics models augmented by AI**  
   Using AI to **accelerate, extend or correct** existing physical models (e.g. thermodynamic and kinetic models), in order to explore larger design spaces and capture complex behaviours that are difficult to treat analytically.

2. **AI models augmented by physics**  
   Embedding **physical constraints and prior knowledge** directly into AI models to improve their **robustness, generalisation and interpretability**, especially in regimes where data are scarce or highly heterogeneous.

3. **Physics-based synthetic data for AI**  
   Exploiting **physics-based models as generators of synthetic data** to complement limited experimental datasets, and building **multi-fidelity frameworks** that combine simulated and experimental data in a controlled way, enabling performant AI models in **data-poor regimes**.

## Key Achievements

I am the author or co-author of **120+ papers** in international peer-reviewed journals and have delivered around **50 invited talks** at international conferences and universities. I have coordinated or led numerous **EU-funded, national, and industry-partnered projects**, and in 2018 I received the **Constellium Prize of the French Academy of Sciences** for my contributions to metallurgy.
