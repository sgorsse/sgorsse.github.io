I am a professor of materials science at the Institute for Condensed Matter Chemistry of Bordeaux (ICMCB, CNRS) and Bordeaux INP in France, which I joined in 2001. Since September 2025, I have been based in Singapore as an **Adjunct Senior Researcher at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, within CINTRA, working on AI-guided design of advanced alloys and catalysts. Since 2020, I have also held an **Honor Chair Professorship** at National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan).

My work focuses on **alloy design**, **high-entropy and complex concentrated alloys (HEAs/CCAs)**, and **artificial intelligence for materials science**. I combine physical metallurgy and computational thermodynamics with data-driven approaches to understand and design metallic materials for energy and sustainability.

More specifically, I am interested in:
* designing and optimising HEAs and related alloys for structural and functional applications,  
* using thermodynamic and mechanistic modelling to rationalise phase stability and microstructure–property relationships,  
* developing machine learning and AI workflows, from feature engineering and predictive models to active learning and closed-loop design, to accelerate materials discovery.

Over the years, I have held visiting positions at several international institutions, including Wright State University (USA, 2016), Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium, 2017), the Institute of Materials Science (Vietnam, 2019), and National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan, 2020).

## Key Achievements

I am the author or co-author of **120+ papers** in international peer-reviewed journals and have delivered around **50 invited talks** at international conferences and universities. I have coordinated or led numerous **EU-funded, national, and industry-partnered projects**, and in 2018 I received the **Constellium Prize of the French Academy of Sciences** for my contributions to metallurgy.
